# ASP.NET Core getting started application

The [Getting started tutorial for ASP.NET Core](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-foundry?topic=cloud-foundry-getting_started-dotnet) uses this sample application to provide you with a sample workflow for working with any .NET Core app on IBM Cloud. In the workflow, you set up a development environment, deploy an app locally and on IBM Cloud, and integrate a IBM Cloud database service in your app. For detailed instructions, see the tutorial.

The ASP.NET Core getting started application uses a [Cloudant service](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant) from IBM Cloud to add information to a database and then return information from the database to the application UI.

The user enters the name, Mary and the screen refreshes to display, Hello, Mary, I've added you to the database. The database contents listed are now Mary, Joe, Jane, and Bob.">

## Common errors

```
docker logs 3a1
Error:
  An assembly specified in the application dependencies manifest (GetStartedDotnet.deps.json) was not found:
    package: 'Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore', version: '2.1.1'
    path: 'lib/netstandard1.6/Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.AspNetCore.dll'
  This assembly was expected to be in the local runtime store as the application was published using the following target manifest files:
    aspnetcore-store-2.0.0-linux-x64.xml;aspnetcore-store-2.0.0-osx-x64.xml;aspnetcore-store-2.0.0-win7-x64.xml;aspnetcore-store-2.0.0-win7-x86.xml
```
Solution:
Add the following to .csproj:
```
<PropertyGroup>
  <PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest>false</PublishWithAspNetCoreTargetManifest>
</PropertyGroup>
```


The ouput of the command `kubectl describe po/<pod-instance-name>` contains *Cannot pull image - Unauthorized*
Solution:
The secrets to connect to the container registry are missing somehow. You need to recreate those secrets in the cluster:
```
ibmcloud ks cluster pull-secret apply --cluster <cluster_name_or_ID>
```
